<h1>Issues</h1>
  <h2>Tax Changes</h2>
    <p>The current tax system doesn't represent the current American. Our tax system will allow you to pick where some of your taxes go so you can chose what gets funded. <a href="https://mills888dev.github.io/WEBSITE/Issues/Taxes.html">Read more</a> </p>
    <h2>Gun Control</h2>
    <p>We will add restrictions on high-power rifles, automatics, and high-capacity weapons while keeping the same regulations for self defense/hunting weapons.  <a href="https://mills888dev.github.io/WEBSITE/Issues/Gun%20control.html">Read more</a> </p>
    <h2>Border Security</h2>
    <p>We will increase officers at the southern border and add staffing for immigration legal cases. We will also limit the number of new legal cases that can be filed each day while making it easier to work while waiting for updated status. <a href="https://mills888dev.github.io/WEBSITE/Issues/Border%20Security.html">Read more</a></p>
