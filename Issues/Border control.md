<h1>Border Security</h1>

<p>We will add more officers at the border and increase staffing for immigration legal cases. We will also limit the number of people allowed parole each day while making it easier to work while waiting for asylum.</p>

<h2>our changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Limit the number of people that can be allowed parole each day</li>
<li>Make exceptions for people with appointments</li>
<li>Add more officers to stop crossings outside ports of entry</li>
<li>Fund new tech for them to use</li>
<li>Add more surveillance on the water</li>
<li>Add more staff to work on immigration cases</li>
<li>Make it possible for immigrants to work while waiting for asylum</li>
<li>Pay for citizenship to pay for this and price will be scaled based on how much funding is needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>how will this affect you</h2>
<p>It shoudnt affect you to much but it could cause mass imegrations due to the pay for citizenship but should overall increase stability in certain cloes to the border communities/towns.</p>
