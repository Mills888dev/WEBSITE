        <li>we are changing how we regulate firearms</li>
            <li>Self defense/hunting weapons such as(SBR, Shotguns, Pistols, rifles, etc…) should mostly stay under the same regulations.</li>
            <li>High-power rifles, automatics, and high-capacity weapons will be relocated and more accesible but not removed. By taking a note from other countries who don't have as bad firearm problems by locking them up in the place that they are used(ranges, trap shooting locations, etc…) and only allowing the owners of such firearms to take them home by limited permits for taking out weapons that require extensive background and psychological checks each time and are limited to 1 month.</li>
        <li>Limiting licenses to only last 1 year and required yearly psychological evaluations.</li>
        <li>Crack down on illegal weapons by fixing mental health.</li>
        <li>Charging parent for crimes of their children(based on severity)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How it will affect you as a gun owner</h2>
