    <h1>Gun Control</h1>
    <h2>Our changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We will increase funding for firearm education and mental health resources.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>We should change how we regulate firearms</li>
            <li>Self defense/hunting weapons such as(SBR, Shotguns, Pistols, rifles, etc…) should mostly stay under the same regulations.</li>
            <li>High-power rifles, automatics, and high-capacity weapons should be regulated but not removed. Possibly by taking a note from other countries who don't have as bad firearm problems which is locking them up in the place that they are used or their ammunition(ranges, trap shooting locations, etc…) and not allowing the owners of such firearms to take them home or allow limited permits for taking out weapons that require extensive background and psychological checks.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Limiting licenses to only last ~1 year and required routine psychological evaluations.</li>
        <li>Crack down on illegal weapons by fixing mental health.</li>
        <li>Charge parent for crimes of their children(based on severity)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How it will affect you a gun owner</h2>
        <p>People owning firearms will need to give up certain firearms to ranges or similar locations. Current firearm licences will become null/void in 6 months unless renewed before hand by going to a psycological evaluation.</p>
