    <h1>Gun Control</h1>
    <p>We will add restrictions on High-power rifles, automatics, and high-capacity weapons while keeping the same regulations for Self defense/hunting weapons.</p>
    <h2>Our Changes</h2>
    <li>We will increase funding for firearm education and mental health resources.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>we are changing how we regulate firearms</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Self defense/hunting weapons such as(SBR, Shotguns, Pistols, rifles, etc…) should mostly stay under the same regulations.</li>
            <li>High-power rifles, automatics, and high-capacity weapons will be relocated but more accesible and not removed. By taking a note from other countries who don't have as bad firearm problems we will be locking them up in the place that they are used(ranges, trap shooting locations, etc…) only allowing the owners of such firearms to take them home by getting time limited permits for taking out weapons that require extensive background and psychological checks each time and are limited to at most 1 month.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Limiting licenses to only last 1 year and required yearly psychological evaluations.</li>
        <li>Crack down on illegal weapons by fixing mental health.</li>
        <li>Charging parent for crimes of their children(based on severity)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How it will affect you as a gun owner</h2>
        <p>People owning firearms will need to give up certain firearms to ranges or similar locations. Current firearm licences will become null/void in 6 months unless renewed before hand by going to a psycological evaluation.</p>
